                <p>Hello Iqi, so this is my real wishes for you.<br>
                Not that the last one is fake, but this one is wishes that<br>
                i haven't told you (or longer one). By the way, welcome to the Acolyte Realm.<br>
                And congratulation for figuring out the password.
                <br><br>
                You may wonder, why did i put this song again and why<br>
                am i never get tired of this song.<br>
                I think this song is very well composed and it reminds me<br>
                of the first time i fell in love with you.<br>
                It was beautiful.
                <br><br>
                Again, Happy Birthday Baby! (i probably have said this for several times)<br>
                I am very happy to have the privilege to grow with you<br>
                To be with you at your lowest and your highest point in life<br>
                And to have your love without me asking.
                <br><br>
                I have grown so much because of you,<br>
                I became a little nicer to people<br>
                I know how to interact with people<br>
                You taught me how to deliver my thoughts in an actual word<br>
                You taught me how to say thank you to my loved ones<br>
                (Because if i'm really close to someone, i never say thank you <br>
                I thought they already know that i am grateful. But then i thought<br>
                It's nice for people to hear a thank you.)
                <br><br>
                You are the one who made me realize that<br>
                time conquer distance.<br>
                Just like when we went to Bandung for the first time,<br>
                It only took you a day to take me everywhere in Bandung<br>
                And bring me home safely the same day.<br>
                We can go everywhere if we spent our time well and not wasting it.
                <br><br>
                Having you in my existence is such a blessing<br>
                You are my first real boyfriend and i hope<br>
                you will be my last.<br>
                I have always had a great time with you and<br>
                you always ease both my insecurities and anxieties.<br>
                Your presence feels so warming<br>
                I feel really safe in your embrace<br>
                <br><br>
                I don't know what wishes i should make for you<br>
                You don't need wish, because i know<br>
                you will always make it happen by working really hard on it<br>
                But i think i know what fits.
                <br><br>
                My wishes for my baby Iqi :<br>
