                <p>The reason why i made you a website, it's because i wanted<br>
                    to create a different dimension from a chatbot AHAHAHA. Because<br>
                    this is the acolyte realm.
                    <br><br>
                    I had so much fun making the mousehunt chatbot<br>
                    I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE<br>
                    I was running out of ideas, but then i remember<br>
                    How much you love mousehunt and how loyal you are to that game<br>
                    I love seeing your enthusiasm and never-tiredness of mousehunt<br>
                    I think it's a prove that you are very loyal and not easily bored<br>
                    I love seeing your determination at playing mousehunt itself<br>
                    I think i have told you this once, that i really admire you for that
                    <br><br>
                    And also, seeing your friends response<br>
                    It really shows that you are indeed a nice person<br>
                    A very loving, highly spirited and lovable person<br>
                    And to be able to receive different perspective about you<br>
                    from your friends, is very amaaazing.<br>
                    You have created so many impacts in your society.<br>
                    Their story would be different without you in it<br>
                    I hope you always realized how much your friends love you<br>
                    and how much impact that you have created in society.<br>
                </p>
